    I have an experience that I want to share. Not work experience, because I have never worked hahah but this is a very valuable experience for me. The beginning of 2022 I started with a chapter that is not the best. My 10-month-old niece suddenly fell ill and was admitted to the children's ward at Tuanku Jaafar Hospital. My experience began on the second day my niece were in the ward. I replaced my sister to take care of this little one because my sister also had a fever and had to rest at home. All night I had to support this little one because sheâ€™s always crying. Imagine how difficult it is to hold a 10 -month -old baby whose hands are stuffed with needles and water. The whole night I did not sleep. The next day, my whole body ached and felt like wanting a fever. 3 days of caring for this little one with erratic eating and drinking and restless sleep, really tested my perseverance and made me realize that how hard it is for a mother to take care of children. 3 days in the hospital was also a valuable experience that made me realize how difficult the job of doctors and nurses is. This was an experience I will never forget.
