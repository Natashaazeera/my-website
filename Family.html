  <p>This is my happy family. My father, Aznan Bin Masri is a driver at Tuanku Jaafar Hospital Seremban. He is 52 and very committed to his work. May he continue to succeed and always be happy. My mother, Noorisah Kamarudin is a housewife. She previously worked as an editor at a publishing company in Kuala Lumpur and had served as an Assistant Officer at the Negeri Sembilan Public Library.
      Other than that, I have four siblings. I am the third child and have a sister, a brother and a younger brother. We are always happy despite the occasional sibling quarrel. Ha ha, it's totally normal. Which siblings don't fight, right? But we still love each other and help each other because thatâ€™s what mom and dad taught.</p>
